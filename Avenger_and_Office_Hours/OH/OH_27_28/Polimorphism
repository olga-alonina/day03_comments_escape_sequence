= Poly + Morphism ( Many Forms) =

    - Polymorphism is the ability of the object to take on many forms
    - Polymorphism is when reference type is a parent class/interface and object type is child.
    - One Object has different forms

= Calling method in polymorphism =

    - When we call a method, it will call overridden version from a child class, if we have overridden the method.
    - If method is not overridden, it will call parent/super class version.
