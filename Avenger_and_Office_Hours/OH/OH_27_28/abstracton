What is Abstraction ?


	- Abstraction:
				   Focus on essentials , not worry about details
				   Focus on name of actions , not worry about implementation
				   Hiding implementation

	- Abstraction can be done in 2 ways: Abstract Classes, Interface

	- Abstraction helps with "organazing the code", "reusing the code", "less duplicate code"

	- Abstraction cannot exist without inheritance


1- ABSTRACT CLASSES

How can we create abstract class ?

	- Abstract keyword is used to create abstract classes
	- An abstract class can not be instantiated (we cant create OBJECT from this CLASS)
	- Goal is to provide reusable variables and methods to sub classes
	- Abstract Class can have non-abstract and abstract methods
	- Abstract Class can not be  final
	- Can have everything the regular class can have + abstract methods
	- So abstract class only shows WHAT it can do, but not HOW by using abstract methods.


- Methods

	- abstract keyword is used to create abstract method
	- Abstract method does not have body, only have signature
	- Abstract methods may not be declared private or final,static
	- Abstract methods may only be defined in abstract classes OR interfaces
	- Implementing an abstract method in a subclass follows the same rules for overriding a method


		Ex :public abstract void update();


- Concrete Class

	- A non-abstract subClass of abstract Class
	- FIRST CONCRETE class MUST implement all inherited abstract methods


    A --> Abstract
    abstract method1();

    B extends A --> Abstract


    C extends B --> Concrete



 ===== QUESTIONS ====
1- Can we create OBJECT from abstract class ?

    NO, we cant create it

    public abstract class Browser {

    }

    Browser browser = new Browser (); // ERROR

2- What is abstract method ?

    is a method without body / no implememtation and can be placed in interface or abstract class

    public abstract class Browser {
        public abstract void getTitle();
        public abstract void navigate();
    }

3- Where do you add implementation for abstract class ?

    - is added in first concrete class
    - We need to follow all overriding rules

     public  class Chrome extends Browser  {

       public abstract void getTitle(){
         //implementation
       }

        public abstract void navigate(){
        //implementation
       }

    }

4- Can we add non-abstract methods in abstract classes ?

    - Yes we can
    public abstract class Browser {
        public abstract void getTitle();
        public abstract void navigate();

        public void refresh(){
        //implemenation
        }
    }

5- Is this mandatory to have abstract method in abstract class ?

    NO.Abstract class can have  0(ZERO) abstract method as well


6- Can we add constr in abstract class ?

    YES

 public abstract class Browser {
        public abstract void getTitle();
        public abstract void navigate();

        public void refresh(){
        //implemenation
        }

        public  Browser(){
            //constructor
        }
    }


7- If we cant create OBJECT how can we call constr ?

    - From child with super keyword



8- Can we add instance or static variable for abstract classes ?

- Can have everything the regular class can have + abstract methods



9- Can we have static block for  abstract classes ?

- Can have everything the regular class can have + abstract methods

10- Can abstract class extends another abstract class ?

    - YES
    public abstract class A{}
	public abstract class B extends A{}


11 - Can abstract class extends another non - abstract class ?

    - YES

12- Can a class extends multiple abstract classes ?

    - NO --> DIAMOND ISSUE / PROBLEM


13- Can we have static method in abstract classes

    - Yes we can .If it has an implementation

        public abstract class A{

        public static void aMethod (){
            // implementation
        }
        }

14- Can an abstract method be static ?

    - NO . Abstract methods meant to be overriden

15- Can an abstract method be final ?

    - NO . Final methods can not be overriden

16- If the abstract class does not any abstract methods , can we init them ?

    - NO.It is not possible to create OBJECT from abstract classses
