Exceptions

	issue that stops the normal flow of execution

Error

	problem not related to code

Throwable is the parent of Error and Exception classes

Exception class:

	Parent of all exception types

	-> direct child classes are checked exceptions:
		 exceptions that must be handled in compile time

RunTimeException class:

	child of Exception

	-> child classes of the RunTimeException are unchecked, so they occur during runtime

	Example of IndexOutOfBoundsException

           possible references for IndexOutOfBoundsException

             IndexOutOfBoundsException obj =  new IndexOutOfBoundsException();

             RunTimeException obj =  new IndexOutOfBoundsException();

             Exception obj =  new IndexOutOfBoundsException();

Rule for multiple catch blocks:

	when you define multiple catch blocks the Exceptions should be the most specific in the beginning and become more general as they go down

	ex:
        try{

        } catch (IndexOutOfBoundsException e){

        } catch (RuntimeException e){

        } catch (Exception e){

        }

throws

	added to a method signature to allow the program to compile

	-> doesn't handle the exception but allow compiling. If the exception condition is met the exception will still be thrown and the program will stop

	-> useful to ignore checked exceptions

throw

	how exceptions are thrown(caused)

	throw an exception object

	syntax:

		throw new ExceptionType();

difference between try/catch vs throws

	try/catch -> handle exceptions. Define the set of statements that should be executed if a specific exceptions happens

	throws: allowing the program to compile and if exception happens the program still stops

Custom Exceptions
	-> we did for practice to understand how exceptions work

	we made a class

		inherited the RuntimeException class we made an unchecked exception

		inherited the Exception class we made a checked exception

	call the super constructors to assign the messages

	when we created/throw a checked exception, as the person creating the
	 class/object/file, I did not want to handle it, I wanted
	 the users to handle the exception, so we used throws to ignore the exception, allowing the code compile
