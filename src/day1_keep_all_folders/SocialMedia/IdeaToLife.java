/*Extra: Make a bunch of objects and try different things out
- Create an ArrayList of Social Media objects to store both
Facebook and Instagram objects
- Find all the Facebook objects that had less than 5000 friends to
they could be added
- Go through all the Instagram objects and like a picture from each
object
- Check which user has both Instagram and Facebook object by
comparing their full names*/
