Stream Tasks:
    1. Write a program that can remove the duplicated elements of an array of String

    2. Write a program that can remove the duplicated elements of a List of String

    3. Write a program that can count how many "java" and "python" does the array has:
            ex: array = {"Java", "jAVa", "pythON"}

            output:
                countJava = 2
                countPython = 1

    4. Write a program that can count how many negative numbers does the array has
        ex: arr = {1,2,3,4,-4,5,-5}

        output:
            2

    5. Write a program that can count how many Positive numbers does the List has
        ex: List = {1,2,3,4,-4,5,-5}

        output:
            5

    6. Write a program that can return all the negative numbers of the array as a new array
        ex:
            arr = {1,2,3,4,-4,5,-5}

        output:
            {-4, -5}

    7. Write a program that can return all the positive numbers of List without the dupclaites
        ex:
            list = {1,2,3,4,-4,5,-5,1,2,3,4}

        output:
            {1,2,3,4,5}


    8. Write a program that can return the palindrome Strings from a list:
        Ex:
            list = {"Java", "level", "Anna", "Wooden Spoon"};

        output:
            {"level", "Anna"}

    9. Write a program that can return the unique elements of an array as a new array:

        Ex: arr = {1,1,2,3,3,4,5,5,6};

        output:
            {2,4,6}
